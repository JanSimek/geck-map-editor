# GECK::Mapper - Fallout 2 map editor

At the current stage this is nothing more than a map viewer but one day it will hopefully become a fully-featured map editor.

Any help is appreciated.

## Known issues

The application will hang for several seconds when loading a new map or changing map elevation. Loading screen should be implemented in the future.

I would have never been able to reach this stage without the code from [Falltergeist](https://github.com/falltergeist/falltergeist/), [Klamath](https://github.com/adamkewley/klamath), [FRM-Viewer](https://github.com/Primagen/Fallout-FRM-Viewer) and [darkfo](https://github.com/darkf/darkfo).
